				<p>As part of the APT portion of the study, six test lanes (numbered 2 through 7) were constructed considering both open- and dense-graded asphalt surface textures while complying with all standard Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) construction, materials, and in-place (as constructed) methods and specifications.
The data here, include the dense-graded sections. 
Surface strain and rutting profile were collected.</p>

				<p>This database include pressure and strain measurements at the bottom of AC layer under different loading and tire configurations. Two test sections called "Test Pit" and "Test Track" are designed and loaded according to two NGWB and Dual tire assemblies and five different loading and tire pressure configurations.
