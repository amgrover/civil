				23 - Hot Weather Test (2002)</b></a></li>
	<p>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) conducted controlled
		loading tests on the U.S. Route 23 Test Road in hot weather conditions
		in Ohio. The testing was done using four tire types, in both dual and
		wide-base configurations . Two pavement sections, one 8-in (204-mm)
		and one 4-in (102-mm) in thickness, were instrumented with strain
		gage rosettes oriented vertically to measure strain traces induced
		from the passing wheel loads at three different speeds and tire
		inflation pressures.</p>

	<p>A field test ran on the Ohio route US 23 (three sections of
		Northbound, Southbound and ramp) using different load, tire pressure
		and speed according to a test matrix. Response sensors include
		embedded strain gauges, pressure cells, MDD and rosettes at different
		depths.</p>
